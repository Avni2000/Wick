I want to win a hackathon, "reimagine finance" by integrating several things together at once.
1. To do this, I'll make a VSCode extension called Wick - the algorithmic trading extension
2. This allows me to structure my python files the way I want them to, from the file tab. It also allows for easy use of git. 
3. Re. the actual python files, I want to a) provide a method to backtest a particular stock or strategy.
4. I'll connect to the public API for the demo, and we'll use that for all execution. So we need a "deploy strategy button".
4a. So, a user should be able to a) backtest with a python library and b) deploy that strategy in the same extension.
5. We'll allow use of github copilot and the like, or maybe use some free google ai credits.
5a. This will allow users to transform english NLP into python. Should be simple if we add some prompting .MD files and some docs.
6. We want to use tradingview/lightweight-charts to have in house charts in a vscode split tab.
